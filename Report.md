#  SQA Final Project

Here is the report of SQA Final Project


# Team info
Team name: Srz0920
Team member: Renze Sun

##  Objective

The objective of this project is to integrate software quality assurance activities into an existing Python project. Whatever we learned from our workshops will be integrated in the project.

##  Activities

1. Unpack the project MLForensics.zip. 
    > I was able to successfully unpack the project from the GitHub.

2. Upload project as a GitHub repo on github.com. Format of the repo name is Srz0920-SPRING2024-SQA 
	> I did this as required.

3. Create README.md listing my team name and team member in README.md. 
	> I did this as required.

4. Apply the following activities related to software quality assurance:

- 4.a. Create a Git Hook that will run and report all security weaknesses in the project in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed. 
	> I created a Git Hook, run report all security weaknesses in weeknesses.csv

- 4.b. Create a fuzz.py file that will automatically fuzz 5 Python methods of your choice. Report any bugs you discovered by the fuzz.py file. fuzz.py will be automatically executed from GitHub actions. 
	> I created a fuzz.py file, which can automatically fuzz 5 Python methods. The issues I found can be found in my GitHub. In this step, I learned how to implement testing code by fuzzy.

- 4.c. Integrate forensics by modifying 5 Python methods of your choice. 
	> In forensics.py, I edited the 5 methods which can satisfy the requirements. I learned more about how to use this way to test code.

- 4.d. Integrate continuous integration with GitHub Actions. 
	> In this activity, I created Codacity Analysis, just like workshop 8 did. In this activity, I learned more about Codacity Analysis.
